# 🍽️ Personalized Restaurant Recommendation System (RAG + Multi-Agent AI)

A **multi-agent, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based restaurant recommendation system** that delivers **personalized, fact-grounded restaurant suggestions** using user profiles, reviews, and semantic search over a vector database.

This project is designed with **modularity, explainability, and scalability** in mind and follows **industry-grade AI system architecture**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Traditional recommendation systems often provide generic results or rely on static rules.  
This project solves that by combining:

- **User preference modeling**
- **Semantic retrieval using vector embeddings**
- **Multi-agent orchestration**
- **LLM-based reasoning grounded in real data**

The system ensures recommendations are **personalized**, **up-to-date**, and **free from hallucinations**.
